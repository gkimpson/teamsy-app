Using Laravel 8.x

Factories have changed - now classes
in php artisan tinker run `User::factory()->create();`
Also call faker correctly e.g $this->faker->company in the definition()

To manually add your own values to the Factory just add it in the array - User::factory()->count(1)->make(['tenant_id' => 2]);
In this instance we create ONE user (count) and make it but set the tenant_id value to 2

global scopes - auto append the where tenant_id to each call to prevent data leakage, create scopes directoy & create new TenantScope.php class
 add tenant_id to session with event listeners using make:listener command on the login event - once logged in auto append scope to all calls put this into tenant_id in the session first

Livewire component

On ep4 - refactor belongs to tenant trait
