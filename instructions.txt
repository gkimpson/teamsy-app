Using Laravel 8.x

Factories have changed - now classes
in php artisan tinker run `User::factory()->create();`
Also call faker correctly e.g $this->faker->company in the definition()

To manually add your own values to the Factory just add it in the array - User::factory()->count(1)->make(['tenant_id' => 2]);
In this instance we create ONE user (count) and make it but set the tenant_id value to 2
